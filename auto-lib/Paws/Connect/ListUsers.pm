=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::ListUsers - Arguments for method ListUsers on L<Paws::Connect>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListUsers on the
L<Amazon Connect Service|Paws::Connect> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListUsers.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListUsers.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $connect = Paws->service('Connect');
    my $ListUsersResponse = $connect->ListUsers(
      InstanceId => 'MyInstanceId',
      MaxResults => 1,                # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyNextToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $NextToken       = $ListUsersResponse->NextToken;
    my $UserSummaryList = $ListUsersResponse->UserSummaryList;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Connect::ListUsersResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/connect/ListUsers>
